Milestone Project Two <br>Simon Memory Game<br> Interactive Frontend Module 
</h1>


<div> 
The Simon memory game uses four primary colours accompanied by four musical tones.  It's a familiar and accessible game which is playable by all ages and abilities.  Children of the eighties may remember the physical Simon devices.  This project aims to replicate some of the functionality of the physical Simon game through the use of Javascript, HTML and CSS.

## UX

## Project Aim

This memory game should be interactive, easy to use, engaging, challenging and responsive on different devices.

### User Stories

- I played the actual Simon game and would like to try it out online.
- The site seems simple and it looks quite like the Simon game.
- There are no intrusive sounds playing when I visit the site initially.
- I can see the play button to start the game.  I can see a strict option. I can see a score counter.
- If I want to know more I can see an information button on How to Play the game, below the game board.
- The game tones are not unpleasant and some of them are reminiscent of the original game.
- I can turn strict mode off if I want to practice.

### User Experience

- Primary colours are used in keeping with the original game, which users might recognise.
- The Simon name is visible at the top of the page, and also in the centre of the game board.
- The colourful board stands out against a dark background.
- The user sees a dash on the counter prior to engaging with the game.  When they start they should see this counter increment     by 1 on each successful turn. This is common and should be recognisable.
- The green start button has a universally recognised "play" symbol taken from Font Awesome
- Strict mode is automatically activated to allow users to start the game immediately
- There is a "How to Play" button below the game board if the user needs further information on how the game works.  In the "How to Play" section, it is explained that Strict mode can be turned off for practice runs.
- A losing game modal and sound is implemented to signify to players in strict mode that the game is over
- A winning game modal and sound is implemented to signify to players in strict mode that they have won the game
- Users should not need to reload the page or to press the back button as there are clear options available
